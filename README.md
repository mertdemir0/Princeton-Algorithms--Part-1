## Percolation Grade -- %95
>Finds the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.
The percolation threshold is the probability needed for a cell to be open to almost guarantee that a system percolates. A system percolates if there is a connection between the top and bottom of the system.

## Deque and Randomized Queues -- Grade %97
>Implementation of a generic double-ended queue and randomized queue (also knowns as a bag)

http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html

## Collinear Points -- Grade %100
>Given a set of `n` points, outputs all distinct maximal line segments containing at least four collinear points, taking advantage of merge sort's stableness to efficiently find maximal line segments and ignore subsegments (algorithm runs in `O(nlogn)` time).

## 8 Puzzle Grade %95
>Provides a solution to the classic 8-Puzzle problem using a priority queue and the Manhattan distance of all squares from their final position as a heuristic.

## Kd-Trees -- Grade %97
>Performs an efficient `range search` (find all points contained in a query rectangle) and `nearest neighbour search` (find closest point to a query point) using a `2d-tree`.
